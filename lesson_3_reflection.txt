When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to collaborate with others. And to keep changes also remotely.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Wish to have control to pull when I desire, in moments when I'm ready to integrate with other peoples chages.
