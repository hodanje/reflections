When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to collaborate with others. And to keep changes also remotely.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Wish to have control to pull when I desire, in moments when I'm ready to integrate with other peoples chages. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork is clone of repository that was already hosted on GitHub, and fork is directly clonned to GitHub.
	Clone is ineligent copy of some repository. :)
	Branch is one specific version history path of content that is kept inside one repository.
